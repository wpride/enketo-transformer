## Install as module

```bash
npm install enketo-transformer --save
```

## Use as module

```js
var transformer = require('enketo-transformer');
var xform = fs.readFileSync( 'path/to/xform.xml' );
  
var result = transformer.transform( {
    xform: xform
} );
```

## Install as app
1. clone repo
2. install dependencies with `npm install`

## Use as app

1. start with `npm start`
2. use with queryparameter e.g. with http://localhost:8085/transform?xform=http://myxforms.com/myxform.xml

	"form" : "<form>.....</form>",
	"model": "<model>...</model>"
}
	
```
